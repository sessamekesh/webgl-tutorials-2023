Companion code for Indigo Code WebGL 2023 tutorial series

# How this repository is structured

The main purpose of this repository is to hold code for the Indigo Code WebGL 2023 YouTube series, but there are quite a few helpful demos that I include here as well.

Source code taught in the videos can be found in the `src` directory, with the video number/title - e.g. `src/01-hello-triangle`.

I wrote quite a few little demos too, which are nice for showcasing certain concepts in graphics programming - these are under `src/demos`, for example `src/demos/vertex-inputs`.

I probably won't bother to keep the live demo code exactly in sync with the demo code in this repository, but it should be close enough.
